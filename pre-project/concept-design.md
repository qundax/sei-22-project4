# Concept Design

### Problem Statement

> As someone in a relationship, I want a way for my partner and me to keep track of various aspects of our relationship in one app.
>
> What we have now is very inconvenient as we have to rely on multiple apps to achieve different things: a calendar app for keeping track of appointments, a countdown app to track important dates in our relationship, and an image hosting site to post private photos.

### Solution

> The solution is to create an app that is able to perform all the features mentioned above. Having all the features available in one app will make owning several apps redundant and both save time, and improve user experience.
